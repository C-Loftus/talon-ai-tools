## About

Use large language models and AI tools alongside Talon. Currently supports:

- Github Copilot
- OpenAI API (GPT-3.5/GPT-4) for text generation and processing
  - Any OpenAI compatible model endpoint can be used (Azure, local llamafiles, etc)
- OpenAI API for image generation and vision

These tools are helpful to automatically generate text, fix errors in dictation, and generally speed up your Talon workflow.
