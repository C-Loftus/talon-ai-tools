GPT commands make requests to an LLM endpoint. In talon each GPT command is prefixed with the word `model`. A model command has 4 parts

- `model`
- A prompt name
- A source _(optional)_
- A destination  _(optional)_


## Examples 


| Command                        | Explanation                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `model fix grammar`            | Fix typos in the selected text and paste the response. `fix grammar` is the prompt name.             |
| `model fix grammar to clip`    | Fix typos in the selected text and put the result on the clipboard. `to clip` is a destination.       |
| `model explain clip to window` | Explains the text on the clipboard and puts the response in a new browser window. `clip` is the source. `to window` is the destination. |

You can mix and match any combination of prompt, source, and destination. 

There are also a few other special commands like `model please` and `model ask` that don't use a prompt, but instead the user's arbitrary natural language request.
