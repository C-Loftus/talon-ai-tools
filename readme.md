# Talon-AI-Tools

**Control large language models and AI tools through voice commands using the [Talon Voice](https://talon.wiki) dictation engine.**

This functionality is especially helpful for users who:

- want to quickly edit text and fix dictation errors
- code by voice using tools like [Cursorless](https://www.cursorless.org/)
- have health issues affecting their hands and want to reduce keyboard use
- want to speed up their workflow and use AI commands across the entire desktop

**Prompts and extends the following tools:**

- Github Copilot
- OpenAI API (GPT-3.5/GPT-4) for text generation and processing
  - Any OpenAI compatible model endpoint can be used (Azure, local llamafiles, etc)
- OpenAI API for image generation and vision

## Help and Setup:

- Clone this repo into your Talon user directory.
- Read the readme in each folder for more information on how to set up and use each tool.
