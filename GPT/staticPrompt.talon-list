## FORMATTING
format table: The following markdown text is raw data. The first row is the header. There is no index. Return the text in a markdown table format. Each row has a new line in the original data.
format bullets: Convert the every paragraph into a one heading with series of bullet points underneath it. Each paragraph is separated by a new line. Separate paragraphs should not have combined bullet points. This should all be done in markdown syntax. If it is a small paragraph than you can just leave it as a heading and not add bullet points. Do not reduce content, only reduce things that would be redundant. These bullet points should be in a useful format for notes for those who want to quickly look at it. If there is a citation in the markdown original then keep the citation just at the top and not within every individual bullet point. 
format mermaid: convert the following plain text into the text syntax for a mermaid diagram.
