# Integrate TTS (text-to-speech) with the responses of GPT commands

## Setup

To use tts you must clone [https://github.com/C-Loftus/sight-free-talon](https://github.com/C-Loftus/sight-free-talon) into your user directory

- See the installation instructions for OS specific setup
- This uses the builtin TTS from your OS. TTS via the OpenAI API is expensive and slow and is currently not recommended for real time user interaction.
