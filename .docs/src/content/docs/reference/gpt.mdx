GPT commands make requests to an LLM endpoint. In our grammar, each GPT command is prefixed with the word `model`. A model command has 4 parts

- `model`
- A prompt name
- A source _(optional; defaults to selected text)_
- A destination _(optional; defaults to paste)_

You can mix and match any combination of prompt, source, and destination.

## Examples

| Command                        | Explanation                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `model fix grammar`            | Fix typos in the selected text and paste the response. `fix grammar` is the prompt name.                                                |
| `model fix grammar to clip`    | Fix typos in the selected text and put the result on the clipboard. `to clip` is a destination.                                         |
| `model explain clip to window` | Explains the text on the clipboard and puts the response in a new browser window. `clip` is the source. `to window` is the destination. |

## Other model commands

There are also a few other special commands like `model please` and `model ask` that don't use a prompt, but instead use the user's arbitrary natural language request.

| Command               | Description                               | Example                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `model help`          | Show the help menu with all the prompts   | "model help"                              |
| `model please <text>` | Say an arbitrary prompt and then apply it | "model please translate this to Japanese" |
| `model ask <text>`    | Ask a question to the model               | "model ask what is the meaning of life"   |
